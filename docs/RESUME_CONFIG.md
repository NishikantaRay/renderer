4. **Live Test**: View the actual resume page at `resume.html`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**TOML Syntax Errors:**
- Ensure strings are quoted: `name = "John Doe"`
- Use `[[section]]` for arrays, `[section]` for objects
- Check for proper indentation and formatting

**Content Not Showing:**
- Verify field names match the documentation
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all required fields are provided

**Formatting Issues:**
- Check date formats are consistent
- Verify array syntax for lists
- Ensure proper nesting for skill categories

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to load resume.toml"**: Check file exists and syntax is valid
- **"No container found"**: HTML structure issue, check resume.html
- **"TOML parser failed"**: Network issue or invalid TOML syntax
